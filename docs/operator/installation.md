# Setting Up Gardener Syncer

## Context

The Gardener Syncer is a Cron Job running on the Kyma Control Plane that periodically fetches the available Gardener Seed regions and stores them in a ConfigMap within the Kyma Control Plane. 
This is essential for KEB services to determine if a Seed is available in the same region as the Shoot cluster.
